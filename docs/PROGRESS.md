## 2026-10-15 — Plan approved (Mode A)
- Approved plan: `docs/PLAN_2026-10-15.md`. Creator decisions: D-13 (Claude Code sessions draft research and scripts),
  D-21 (separate repository), repo name `explainer-engine`.
- Spend: Gemini $0.00 of $10; vidIQ 0 of 200 credits (account balance read 2026-10-15: 395, call cost 0).

## 2026-10-15 — Phase 1: new repo, inventory & safeguards (in progress)
- Blocker: creating `vano1919/explainer-engine` through the GitHub integration returned 403 ("Resource not accessible
  by integration"). The scaffold was built and committed in a local repository; it is pushed once the creator creates
  the empty repository and it is attached to the session.
- Done: scaffold (`explainer_engine/core`, `explainer_engine/audio`, `tests/unit`, `docs/`), `.gitignore` (jobs, media,
  models, keys), `requirements.txt` (numpy, jsonschema, pyyaml, pytest), `pytest.ini`, `setup.ps1`, `CLAUDE.md`;
  copied modules with provenance (`docs/PROVENANCE.md`); `docs/REPO_REUSE_AUDIT.md`.
- Tests (Linux sandbox, Python 3.13, fresh venv): `python -m pytest -q` → 24 passed. The guard test was checked
  against a planted `from tmr_engine import x` (it failed as intended). Not tested: `setup.ps1` on Windows.
- Not done in Phase 1 by design: Kokoro, Node/Remotion, schemas (Phases 3–5).
- Next: Phase 2, the decision and specification pack (split the plan into the canonical docs), Kit reference sheet
  draft, palette contrast check.
- Recovery: the local clone is a plain git repository; `git push -u origin main` after `git remote add origin ...`.
